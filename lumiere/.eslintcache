This peculiar tradition\r\n                is observed every year in honour of a local deity with a temple\r\n                to her name at the centre of the town. Our readers might be\r\n                familiar with the pond adjacent to the temple. It is a\r\n                destination for the elderly who have their daily walks there and\r\n                for kids who frolic around under the watch of the elders and\r\n                enjoy feeding puffed rice to the plethora of fish that teem the\r\n                pond.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Throughout Aani, Bharathiyar Street, which houses the Karaikal\r\n                Ammaiyar temple and an assortment of other temples close by,\r\n                lights up in celebrations. The temple packs a ton of classical\r\n                music and dance performances and the streets surrounding the\r\n                temple play host to small shops selling all sorts of interesting\r\n                trinkets, pots and pans, toys, mobile accessories, ice cream,\r\n                popcorn, and cotton candy. For our freshers looking to make a\r\n                fully featured home out of their hostel rooms, the timing cannot\r\n                be more apt to go splurging for provisions and utensils. The\r\n                month-long extravaganza commemorating Karaikal Ammaiyar\r\n                (Karaikal Mother) features the iconic Maangani Thiruvizha (Mango\r\n                Festival) wherein a few thousand people from Karaikal and the\r\n                nearby towns and villages gather in the four streets of\r\n                Bharathiyar Street, French Teacher Street, Church Street and La\r\n                Mer street (means the sea in French, a reminder of Karaikal’s\r\n                colonial days) to grab the mangoes tossed from the rooftops on\r\n                either side of these streets, following the procession that\r\n                starts from the temple, loops the four streets in the\r\n                aforementioned order and culminates at the temple again. It is\r\n                believed that catching and eating a mango is to be blessed by\r\n                Lord Shiva himself. As to why, we will get there in a moment.\r\n                The crowd gets into such a frenzy that a significant police\r\n                presence becomes mandatory every year to control the mob. Not\r\n                only that, NCC and NSS volunteers from schools and colleges in\r\n                Karaikal, including ours, supplement the police force to handle\r\n                the surplus influx that squeeze into the four narrow streets.\r\n                Here is an excerpt from an official announcement from the local\r\n                administration to give you an idea of what it is like: “In view\r\n                of the Mangani Festival elaborate arrangements were made in all\r\n                the three important days from 26/06/2018 to 28/06/2018 during\r\n                which around 400 Police personnel including 120 Recruit Police\r\n                Constables and 80 Head Constables were deployed for bandobust\r\n                duties along with 200 Police personnel of Karaikal.”\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Article;\r\n","C:\\Users\\Vishnuprasadh\\OneDrive\\Projects\\lumiere\\lumiere\\lumiere\\src\\widgets\\ButtonCarousel\\ButtonCarousel.js",[],{"ruleId":"33","replacedBy":"34"},{"ruleId":"35","replacedBy":"36"},{"ruleId":"37","severity":1,"message":"38","line":3,"column":8,"nodeType":"39","messageId":"40","endLine":3,"endColumn":12},{"ruleId":"41","severity":1,"message":"42","line":47,"column":15,"nodeType":"43","endLine":47,"endColumn":184},"no-native-reassign",["44"],"no-negated-in-lhs",["45"],"no-unused-vars","'Home' is defined but never used.","Identifier","unusedVar","jsx-a11y/alt-text","img elements must have an alt prop, either with meaningful text, or an empty string for decorative images.","JSXOpeningElement","no-global-assign","no-unsafe-negation"]
